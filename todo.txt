add some settings
remove the form from the header and put it in a modal instead
error handling modal
do splash screen
add a place to copy the save/share URL



look into bookmarklet/extension
look into preventing text selection when dragging chart
make mongo code handle duplicates - maybe, what about updates?
check analytics


blue borders on shit
enlarge cards onclick
expand cards down not up

CODE CLEANUP
try to eliminate style= inline
check form-danger-color
check js uikit components like nav dropdown, switcher, subnav, etc
move http calls to a service on front end, double check backend code org

fix all js errors

had appendFile not appendFileSync - see if there could possibly be types mismatched
