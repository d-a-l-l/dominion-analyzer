# dominion-analyzer

The /api folder is deprecated. All that game parsing logic was moved into /analyzer so it is now a standalone webapp. Cheaper and easier to maintain without the mongoDB saving analysis.

/analyzer is a react webapp.

Built on Node. Install node first.

From /analyzer folder, run `npm install`
Then run `npm run start` to run a development folder.
`npm run build` will produce the production build to /build.
See package.json scripts for more.
